"""Which seed a TS3 submission is filed under, and where that number comes from.

The seed names the file, so it has to be whatever differs between two runs of one model:
the finetuning seed for the transductive extractors, whose pretrain checkpoint is shared,
and the pretraining seed for the inductive ones. An extractor reporting a constant would
collapse a sweep into one submission, and every file would still look well formed.
