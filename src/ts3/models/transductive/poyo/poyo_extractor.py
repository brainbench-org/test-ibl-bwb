"""POYO's unit-embedding extractor.

A POYO unit embedding is its row of ``unit_emb``, the input token the model learned for that
unit. Rows exist only for units the checkpoint was trained on, and the pretrain vocabulary is
built from the pretrain sessions alone, so the eval units are simply absent from the pretrain
checkpoint. That is the whole reason this model is transductive and not a config away from
being inductive.
