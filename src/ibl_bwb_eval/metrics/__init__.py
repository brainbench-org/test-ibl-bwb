"""Metric definitions the benchmark reports.

These are the metrics a submission is scored on, so they live with the scorer rather
than with the training code, and training-time logging imports them from here too: a
change to one moves every number already reported, which importing them by way of
``core`` would hide. ``core.nn.metrics`` keeps only diagnostics that are scored by
nothing.
