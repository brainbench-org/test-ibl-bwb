"""Tests for the search path :class:`ModelConfigDiscovery` builds.

The plugin decides, per entry point, which model packages ship configs into the run. It
is the only thing standing between an app and a ``trainer=`` name it should never see,
and getting it wrong is quiet: a suite that picks up a foreign package composes a config
that resolves, instantiates, and trains the wrong thing. The contract is pinned as the
exact reachable set, read off the filesystem, so moving a model package fails here first.
