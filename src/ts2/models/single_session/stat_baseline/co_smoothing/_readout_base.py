"""Shared machinery for the observed-to-held-out reduced-rank readouts.

Both methods map the observed units ``O`` to the held-out units ``H`` at each
timestep with a rank-constrained ridge, differing only in their regressors:
``RRRReadout`` uses binned counts, ``RRRReadoutWithISI`` augments them with spike timing. H is
the fixed ``is_held_out_test`` unit mask (the units scored at test),
and since H and O are disjoint, predicting H from O is leakage-free.

Hyperparameters are selected on the val hold-out draw, then the readout is refit for
the test one, so the scored units take no part in selection.
