"""NDT-stitch's unit-embedding extractor.

The embedding is the unit's pair of stitcher columns, ``[in.T, out]`` concatenated to 2D.
Those are per-session parameters, so as with POYO they exist only for the sessions a
checkpoint was trained on, and the units come from the recording rather than from a lookup:
the stitcher has no vocabulary, only a column order matching ``units.id``.
