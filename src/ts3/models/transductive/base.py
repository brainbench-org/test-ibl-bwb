"""What every transductive extractor shares: which checkpoint answers which regime.

The train side comes from the shared pretrain checkpoint and the eval side from one
finetuning checkpoint per eval recording, so the eval half of the embeddings file is a
concatenation across encoders that drifted apart on their own sessions. That is the regime,
not a defect, but it is why the two halves are less comparable here than under
``ts3.models.inductive``, and why the probe is the only thing that ever sees them together.

Subclasses supply :meth:`read`, which turns one checkpoint into embeddings for the units it
was trained on. They exist as a family because for these models a unit embedding is a free
parameter indexed by unit identity: no row exists for a unit the checkpoint never saw, so
there is nothing to read for held-out units without finetuning on them first.
